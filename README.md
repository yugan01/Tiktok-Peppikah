## General Overview
After creating echo.thrift in the idl folder, we used the Hertz framework to generate code for biz and hertz_gateway.
We then used the Kitex framework to generate the code scaffold and server code under kitex_gen and kitex folders respectively.
Lastly, we created a gateway module in biz which acts as an abstracted program to handle all the generic calls.
